# Next job

This file is the handoff point for the next coding session. **Every pull request that changes the app must update this file before it is merged.** Move finished work to the short completed list, place the next unfinished deliverable at the top, and update its acceptance checks. The full scope lives in [docs/BUILD_PLAN.md](docs/BUILD_PLAN.md).

## Next deliverable: crossword

Build a crossword from the same saved lesson data. Use a small set of short, distinct answer words with clear clues in the front language. Generate a connected, solvable grid with correct numbered starts and no conflicting intersections. Preserve Polish and German characters. If Arabic cannot be presented readably in this grid, explain the language gate rather than showing broken letters.

Acceptance checks:

1. The crossword uses saved lesson pairs, explains when it cannot make a fair grid, and allows keyboard entry and navigation.
2. Every clue maps to one answer; numbered starts, intersections, and answer checking agree with the generated grid.
3. Accents remain significant. Incorrect attempts provide feedback without destroying the learner's entries.
4. Update this file before merging the PR. Keep the browser acceptance item below open until it is exercised on Windows.

## Open browser acceptance gate

On the intended Windows browser, attach pictures and recordings, save, close/reopen, export, import on another browser/computer, and play with the network disconnected. Confirm the JSON contains WebP and audio bytes rather than source paths. Review desktop and narrow widths, keyboard focus, Arabic RTL, and reduced motion visually and fix any defects found. The cloud browser blocked the local `file://` app, so code review and local checks do not close this gate.

## Completed in code

- Initial offline HTML/CSS/JavaScript starter: named lessons, four languages, JSON backup, flashcards.
- Activity roadmap and shared text-game foundation: multiple choice, matching pairs, typed spelling, restrained feedback motion and sound, mute control.
- Version 2 portable media: WebP conversion, per-language audio, IndexedDB working copy, self-contained JSON, old export migration, picture choice, and listen and choose. Ambiguous duplicate media clues are excluded. The layout, focus path, responsive game screens, progress bars, reduced-motion behavior, and synthesized feedback cues received a code-level polish pass. Windows browser acceptance remains open above.
- First Unicode spelling games: letter tiles, missing letters, and listen-and-type use the shared lesson, preserve grapheme clusters, skip unsuitable words, allow keyboard play, and offer a retry before revealing the answer. Listen-and-type requires an answer-language recording and starts it only when Play is pressed.
- Letter guess uses a bounded mistake count and target grapheme tiles, including marked Arabic letters. Word search uses 3–5 short Polish, German, or English words, supports keyboard selection of endpoints, and has a guaranteed solvable placement fallback. Arabic answer words receive a clear availability message for word search.

## After this job

Finish memory cards, true or false, picture labels, category sort, sentence order, and sentence completion; then learner progress and the complete browser acceptance pass. **One-click Windows packaging is phase 2 only.**
